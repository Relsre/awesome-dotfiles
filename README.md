# dotfiles
Personal dotfiles for my laptop (Arch Linux), using a setup based around artwork from [Hyper Light Drifter (background)](https://www.heart-machine.com) and [Base16 Atelier Cave (Dark)](https://github.com/khamer/base16-termite/blob/master/themes/base16-atelier-cave.config). This includes my configuration files for AwesomeWM 4.2, custom GTK+ theme (Oomox-Numix), dunst, termite, csxlock, Firefox (userChrome / Stylish), newsboat, vim, and ncmpcpp.

This setup makes heavy use of [GohuFont](font.gohu.org).

The custom GTK+ theme and matching icons was made via [Oomox](https://github.com/actionless/oomox), slightly modified from the preset Numix-based Atelier Cave (Dark) theme.

Firefox uses several Stylish themes, some with modified colours (as found in the FF-css directory), as follows:
* [Clear Dark Facebook](https://userstyles.org/styles/136318/clear-dark-facebook-by-book777)
* [Nocturnal SoundCloud](https://userstyles.org/styles/129712/nocturnal-soundcloud-theme)
* [YouTube DeepDark Material](https://userstyles.org/styles/144962/youtube-deepdark-material)
* [GitHub Dark](https://userstyles.org/styles/37035/github-dark)

The userChrome.css for Firefox uses the following CSS hacks in the [UserChrome-Tweaks](https://github.com/Timvde/UserChrome-Tweaks) repository:
* Auto-hide URL bar
* Sliding Bookmarks bar
* Compact tab height

[Dark Background and Light Text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-background-light-text/) with modified colours is also used.
